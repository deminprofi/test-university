# Hello

This is a page of a test site.

temp.js holds the data objects needed to display content on the site. It is assumed that the data will be received from the server and processed already in the main app.js

Link to view page: 

https://deminprofi.github.io/test-university/index.html

On the right there is a button attached that opens a modal window where the data filling is visualized.

Thank you for your attention.
